              <h3> GFI FaxMaker<span class = 'float-right'>Jan 2020 - Present</span></h3>
              The GFI FaxMaker Online administration dashboard allows you to
              graphically view your fax communications over time and drill down
              to send or received transmissions. It also gives you a breakdown
              of your international faxing history, a list of the top area codes
              used when you fax, and the fax numbers you have available. All of
              this information helps you determine if it’s necessary to request
              additional fax numbers. Moreover, GFI FaxMaker Online shows how
              you are helping the environment on the “Trees Saved” section of
              the dashboard. Using an electronic online fax service helps reduce
              the amount of paper you use – which saves money and trees.
